This assignment is to create a simple attendance tracker for our class.

The program should prompt the user for the attendance of each person in the class, to include the instructor.

The response can be Yes/No, or Y/N or 1/0 or Yep/Nope or Present/Absent or whatever you prefer to use, so long as your program can interpret the response.

Upon completion, this program should output the number of people in the classroom, along with the names of those absent.

The initial attendance.c file is not a completed example, it's merely a template to get you going.
